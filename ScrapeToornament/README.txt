README for ~/ScrapeToornament/

Basic info:
	This folder contains the python modules necessary to run the tool.

Contents:
	main.py
		Executes the tool.
		Set the variable main.py/tournament_url to the toornament-url of your choice and run main.py

	scrapetoor.py
		Contains the necessary classes and functions.

	testing.py
		Works similar to main.py but allows for testing of specific parts of the tool.
		I'm terrible at best practice coding --> this is not comparable to actual unit testing!
